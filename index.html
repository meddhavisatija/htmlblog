<h2>Web design</h2>
<p>
Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, 
content production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, 
web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.Websites are created using a markup language
called HTML. Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page. The layout and
appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites
 include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser.
